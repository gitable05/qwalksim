# qwalksim
Library for simulating unitary and non-unitary quantum walks on regular graphs.

This is an on-going project to improve my code from our study of [non-unitary quantum walks](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-023-03848-y)
for broader use. The main goal is that this library can be used in various topics within quantum information and computing.
